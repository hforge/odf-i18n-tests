<p>The element makes a shape visible. If there is an element for one shape, this shape is automatically invisible before the effect is executed. </p>
<p>The attribute presentation:effect specifies the type of effect. </p>
<p>laser: this effect is only available for text shapes; the characters of the text are moved one by one from the top edge of the screen to their final position. </p>

<ul style=\"-qt-list-indent: 1;\"><li>the title and subtitle in the first page display laser effect after click the mouse. </li></ul>
