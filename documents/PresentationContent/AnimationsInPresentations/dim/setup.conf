title = "Dim"
description = "<p>In a presentation document, shapes can be animated. Each presentation page can have an optional element, which is a container for animation effects. The animation is executed when the page is displayed during a presentation. </p>
<p>The element fills a shape in a single color. </p>
<p>the expected behavior in the presentation is: the title and subtitle area will be filled with red and green color respectively. </p>
<p>the function didn't fulfill in this test, it may have some following reasons: </p>
<ul style=\"-qt-list-indent: 1;\"><li>so far, we only know a frame can be defined as a presentation shape, other graphic shapes such as draw:rec may be a presentation shape if it is assigned a presentation style which is specified in specification. However, the test case fail to create such rectangular as the presentation shape, and I doubt that the difference between frame and rectangular is in frame it can't be filled in color because all the space is for text, but in rectangular it can fill whatever color we want. </li>
<li>some other properties may control which color it will display, the background color of the page, the background color of the objects or fill color in an object. The definition of layer is a good example for this case. so the animation of dim may successfully fill the color in the presentation shape but we can't see it. </li>
<li>open office application using SMIL to realize the animations in the presentation shapes, so it may ignore some traditional definition in the open document specification.</li></ul>"
